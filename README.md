# Weekly Accomplishments - Week 1

Hello everyone! Welcome to my weekly update. This README serves as a journal of my accomplishments and activities during the first week. Let's dive into what I've been up to:

## Mathematics Studies (OMSCS)

### Introductory Linear Algebra

In the first week, I focused on Introductory Linear Algebra. Here are the key topics I covered:

- Linear Systems and Span
- Solution Sets and Linear Independence

I actively engaged in assignments and coding exercises related to these topics, solidifying my understanding of linear algebra.

## Python Programming

### Ongoing Python Course

In parallel with my mathematics studies, I'm also enhancing my Python programming skills. Here's what I've accomplished in the first week:

- Computing Concepts
- Programming in Python
- Debugging Techniques
- Procedural Programming

I'm actively working on assignments and coding exercises to apply these Python concepts.

## Ecommerce Project

### Spring Boot and Angular

I'm excited to share that I've started working on an eCommerce application. This project is a robust system for an online shopping platform. It encompasses critical functionalities, including:

- User Authentication
- Product Management
- Order Processing
- Data Storage in a MySQL Database

In the first week, I initiated this project and laid the groundwork for its development. This project serves as the backbone of an eCommerce website, and I'm committed to delivering a high-quality solution.

## Plans for Week 2

For the upcoming week, I plan to:

- Dive deeper into linear algebra concepts.
- Explore more advanced Python programming topics.
- Continue the development of the eCommerce project.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey. Stay tuned for next week's update!



# Weekly Accomplishments - Week 2

Hello everyone! Welcome to my weekly update. This README serves as a journal of my accomplishments and activities during the second week. Let's dive into what I've been up to:

## Mathematics Studies (OMSCS)

### Introductory Linear Algebra

In the second week, I delved into more concepts of Introductory Linear Algebra:

- Linear Transforms
- The Matrix Inverse

I actively engaged in assignments and coding exercises related to these topics, solidifying my understanding of linear algebra.

## Python Programming

### Ongoing Python Course

In parallel with my mathematics studies, I'm also enhancing my Python programming skills. Here's what I've accomplished in the second week:

- Variables and Data Types
- Logical and Mathematical Operators
- Control Structures (if, while, for)

I'm actively working on assignments and coding exercises to apply these Python concepts.

## Ecommerce Project

### Spring Boot and Angular

I'm excited to share that I've continued to work on my eCommerce application. This project is a robust system for an online shopping platform. It encompasses critical functionalities, including:

- User Authentication
- Product Management
- Order Processing
- Data Storage in a MySQL Database

In the second week, I made significant progress in the development of this project. This project serves as the backbone of an eCommerce website, and I'm committed to delivering a high-quality solution.

## Plans for Week 3

For the upcoming week, I plan to:

- Deepen my understanding of linear algebra concepts.
- Continue refining my Python programming skills.
- Make further advancements in the eCommerce project.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for next week's update!
